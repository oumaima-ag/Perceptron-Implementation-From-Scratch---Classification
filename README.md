# Perceptron-Implementation-From-Scratch---Classification
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Perceptron model for binary classification. The model is designed to predict the form of cancer (1: malignant, 0: benign) based on seven quantitative features. The dataset consists of 10,000 records, each with seven features, and the target variable is "cancer_form."
